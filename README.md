# Pomodoro Timer
React based website to utilize the Pomodoro focusing method

##Step 1: Set how long user will focus and how long your break will be

##Step 2: Press play and your timer starts

##Step 3: Get to work!

Once one session ends an alarm will sound, telling you to take a break or get back to work. The next session will immediately begin afterwards.
So, once time durations are set the user can leave the timer on in the background without having to monitor. Should they wish the user may see how much time is left in a session precisely, or at a glance look at the progress bar. One can even pause and resume a session in the case of unforseen interruption.
